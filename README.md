# Movie-API-App

Introduction 
=====================

This is a simple learning project for Searching Movie Apps as part of one of my small utilities app, I created using Node.js, Express.js and a few basic CSS and Bootstrap.

How it Works ?
====================
It will first ask you for a search key.

Example: California

Then it will list the movies in accordance with the title name and year.

What is the API used here ?
====================
We use a The Open Movie Data Base Movie API
